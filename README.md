# Disable automatic tab discarding for specific domains
Stops Chrome from suspending tabs, and reloading them when you switch to them for specific tabs.


## See if this is working
Open "chrome://discards/" 
The column "AutoDiscardable" should off for all tabs.



## TODOs: 
- Add popup styling (popup.css)
- Add a Input to add to the filter list
- add persistence to DoNotSuspends list
