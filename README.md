# Disable automatic tab discarding for specific domains
Stops Chrome from suspending tabs, and reloading them when you switch to them for specific URL's.


See if this is working:
Open "chrome://discards/" 
The column "AutoDiscardable" should off for all tabs.


Forked this to have a trusted version to use for personal testing.

TODOs: 
- Add functionality to add a list of URL's to not beeing hybernated 
- Theme this plugin
- Add a proper Interface
- Add a proper readme
