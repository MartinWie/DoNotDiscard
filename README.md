# [Discarded here is the new version](https://github.com/MartinWie/DoNotSuspend) 
This plugin is now official discontinued, currently creating a new version [here](https://github.com/MartinWie/DoNotSuspend)

# Install

# Disable automatic tab discarding for specific domains
Stops Chrome from suspending tabs, and reloading them when you switch to them for specific tabs.


## See if this is working
Open "chrome://discards/" 
The column "AutoDiscardable" should off for all tabs.


## TODOs: 
- Add sync feature off chrome chrome.storage.sync.set and chrome.storage.sync.get for keywords
- rewrite extension in V3
- Add vote for extension option
- Add good styling (popup.css)
    - Create better boxing around entries
    - Move the remove button to the right side
    - Wrap keywords into text fields(size visual limitation)
